# AgriculturalCompanyAndroidApp
An App to visualize data from sensors. We created a simple app on android studio that gets the information from sensors and stores them
on ThinkSpeak, a service for Data collection in the cloud, with json format. Moreover, it alerts a specific email when values from the sensors exceed their limits.
The sensors were on a Arduino UNO R3 and send their values via ESP8266
